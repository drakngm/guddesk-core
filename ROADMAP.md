# GudDesk Roadmap

> The open-source customer support platform that combines Intercom-quality UX, Crisp-style workspace pricing, and AI-first resolution — without the enterprise tax.

---

## Vision

Most support platforms charge per-agent, lock AI behind expensive add-ons, and take months to set up. GudDesk takes a different approach: workspace-based pricing, AI included by default, and a setup that takes minutes not months. The goal is to be the platform teams actually enjoy using — both the support team and the customers reaching out.

## Pricing Philosophy

| | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Price | $0 | $29/workspace/mo | ~$99/workspace/mo | Custom |
| Members | 2 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Conversations | 500/mo | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| AI Resolutions | 50/mo | 500/mo | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Channels | Chat + Email | + Social + WhatsApp | + Phone + SMS | + Custom |
| SLAs | - | Basic | Advanced | Custom |
| SSO/SAML | - | - | Yes | Yes |
| Support | Community | Email | Priority | Dedicated |

**Key principle:** Workspace-based pricing, not per-agent. AI is included, not an add-on. No surprise bills.

## Non-Goals

Things we deliberately won't build:

- **Sales CRM** — stay focused on support. Integrate with existing CRMs instead.
- **Marketing automation** — proactive messaging yes, but not a full marketing suite.
- **Project management** — conversations can link to Jira/Linear/GitHub, but we're not building a PM tool.
- **Social media management** — we handle support messages from social channels, not publishing/scheduling.
